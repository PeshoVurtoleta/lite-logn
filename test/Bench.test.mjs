/**
 * @zakkster/lite-logn -- benchmark anti-vacuity + determinism gate.
 *
 * The benchmark suite (the eight-dimension Bench v2 ADOPTED from lite-o1) lands
 * in its own later session (COPY-AND-WIRE, not a rebuild). When it does, this
 * file gates it: every applicable cell is numeric, every inapplicable cell is
 * the string "n/a" (never a numeric 0), and a fixed seed reproduces the
 * traceHash.
 *
 * v0.1.0 is the SCAFFOLD release: there is no `benchmark/` directory yet, so
 * this gate asserts only the scaffold invariants (the harness is wired into the
 * `npm test` glob and the version const is reachable), and runs GREEN. The
 * Benchmark session replaces the body below with the real vacuity + determinism
 * assertions over benchmark/Matrix.mjs.
