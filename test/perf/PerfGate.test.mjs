/**
 * @zakkster/lite-logn -- the HARD zero-allocation perf gate (@zakkster/lite-perf-gate).
 *
 * Run:  node --expose-gc --max-semi-space-size=4 --test test/perf/PerfGate.test.mjs
 *
 * A node:test-native COMPLEMENT to torture (0 B/op), not a replacement. Each
 * member session adds a zero-alloc scenario per hot op (push / pop / peek for
 * BinaryHeap; update / prefix for Fenwick; ...), scavenge-scaled at N and k*N
 * with the old-gen and external / arrayBuffers lanes pinned to 0.
 *
 * v0.1.0 is the SCAFFOLD release: there is NO member yet, so the gated scenarios
 * list is EMPTY (`allowEmpty: true` -- a controls-only detector smoke run). The
 * teeth are already wired: `mustFail` carries an allocating loop that MUST trip
 * the gate, proving the instrument can fail before any member relies on it (suite
 * law 8: every gate must be provably able to FAIL). Never widen a budget to make
 * this pass.
